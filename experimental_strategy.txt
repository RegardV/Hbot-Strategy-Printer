## Experimental Trading Strategy

### Overview
This experimental trading strategy implements a dynamic ping-pong trading approach with market direction analysis and risk management. The strategy uses 24-hour market data and RSI indicators to determine optimal entry points and subsequent trading levels.

### Key Components

#### 1. Market Analysis
- **24hr High/Low**: Establishes the trading range baseline
- **24hr Volume**: Indicates market activity level
- **36hr Volume**: Provides volume trend comparison
- **24hr Direction**: Shows overall market trend percentage
- **RSI Indicator**: Determines market momentum and potential direction

#### 2. Entry Strategy
1. **Initial Direction Assessment**
   - Uses RSI to determine market direction (Up/Down)
   - Analyzes 24hr trend percentage
   - Decides whether to start with a buy or sell order

2. **Price Level Determination**
   - Base Ask Price: Current market ask price
   - Total Spread: Desired trading range
   - Calculates:
     - Current Buy Price = Base Ask Price - (Total Spread / 2)
     - Current Sell Price = Base Ask Price + (Total Spread / 2)

#### 3. Ping-Pong Trading Levels
The strategy creates multiple trading levels for ping-pong trading:
- **Level 1**: Base spread
- **Level 2**: 1.5x base spread
- **Level 3**: 2x base spread

Each level includes:
- Buy price
- Sell price
- Potential ROI calculation

#### 4. Risk Management
- Stop Loss Percentage
- Price Boundaries:
  - Minimum Buy Price
  - Maximum Buy Price
  - Minimum Sell Price
  - Maximum Sell Price

### Trading Process

1. **Initial Setup**
   ```
   1. Connect to exchange
   2. Fetch current market data
   3. Calculate RSI and determine trend
   4. Set base ask price and spread
   ```

2. **Entry Position**
   ```
   If RSI indicates UP:
     Place initial buy order at Current Buy Price
   If RSI indicates DOWN:
     Place initial sell order at Current Sell Price
   ```

3. **Ping-Pong Trading**
   ```
   For each level (1-3):
     Calculate buy price = BaseAskPrice - (TotalSpread * level_multiplier / 2)
     Calculate sell price = BaseAskPrice + (TotalSpread * level_multiplier / 2)
     Calculate ROI = ((sell_price - buy_price) / buy_price) * 100
   ```

4. **Risk Control**
   ```
   Monitor positions:
     If price < MinBuyPrice: Cancel buy orders
     If price > MaxBuyPrice: Cancel buy orders
     If price < MinSellPrice: Cancel sell orders
     If price > MaxSellPrice: Cancel sell orders
     If loss > StopLossPercent: Close position
   ```

### Usage

1. Connect to your preferred exchange
2. Input base configuration:
   - Trading pair
   - Base ask price
   - Total spread
3. Review and set risk parameters
4. Monitor the generated ping-pong levels
5. Activate trading when conditions align

### Important Notes

- Always start with small position sizes
